## ✅ Phase 2: Backend Core (Authentication & Authorization) - COMPLETED

**Completion Date**: December 18, 2024
**Duration**: 1 session (comprehensive Phase 2 completion)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (100%)
**Last Commit**: `b6f8392` - "Complete Phase 2 - Frontend pages and critical security tests"

### Summary

Phase 2 delivered a complete authentication and authorization system with JWT tokens, role-based access control, entity-level access management, comprehensive audit logging, and a working Executive Control Tower dashboard. Added complete frontend pages for compliance instances and audit logs, plus 58 comprehensive backend tests achieving 74% coverage. All APIs are production-ready with multi-tenant isolation verified, RBAC enforcement tested, and immutable audit trails.

### Files Created/Modified

**Backend (6 files, ~1,400 lines)**:
- **Services**: audit_service.py (171 lines), entity_access_service.py (242 lines)
- **Tests (NEW)**: test_dashboard.py (555 lines, 17 tests), test_entity_access_service.py (426 lines, 28 tests), test_rbac.py (413 lines, 13 tests)
- **Config**: requirements.txt (added pytest-cov)
- **Bug Fix**: entity_access_service.py (role.name → role.role_name)

**Frontend (11 files, ~1,300 lines)**:
- **Pages (NEW)**: compliance/page.tsx (355 lines), audit-logs/page.tsx (310 lines)
- **Components (NEW)**: JsonDiff.tsx (115 lines), AuditLogTable.tsx (185 lines)
- **Hooks (NEW)**: useCompliance.ts (62 lines), useAuditLogs.ts (82 lines)
- **Types (NEW)**: compliance.ts (73 lines), audit.ts (75 lines)
- **Updates**: endpoints.ts, hooks/index.ts, types/index.ts, package.json (added test deps)

### Key Accomplishments

#### ✅ Authentication & JWT
- Login/logout/refresh endpoints working
- JWT tokens with `tenant_id`, `user_id`, `roles[]` claims
- Access tokens (24h expiry), refresh tokens (7 days, stored in Redis)
- Token validation middleware on all protected routes
- Password verification with bcrypt

#### ✅ RBAC & Entity Access Control
- Role-based permission checks: `check_role_permission()`
- Entity-level access control via `entity_access` table
- Users only see entities they have permission to access
- Multi-tenant isolation enforced on all queries
- 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access

#### ✅ Audit Logging
- Immutable audit trail (append-only, no UPDATE/DELETE)
- Before/after snapshots stored as JSONB
- Captures: user_id, action_type, resource_type, resource_id, old_values, new_values, IP address, user_agent
- Audit log API restricted to CFO and System Admin roles
- 3 audit log endpoints: list all, get resource trail, get by ID

#### ✅ Dashboard API
- Executive Control Tower: RAG counts, category breakdown, overdue summary
- Overdue compliance instances endpoint
- Upcoming compliance instances (next 7 days)
- Redis caching (5 min TTL) for performance
- Denormalized `tenant_id` in compliance_instances for fast queries

#### ✅ Compliance Instance Management
- List instances with RBAC (users see only accessible entities)
- Get single instance with entity access check
- Update instance with audit logging (captures old/new values)
- All endpoints filter by `tenant_id` for multi-tenant isolation

#### ✅ Frontend Components
- Login page with form validation (React Hook Form + Zod)
- Executive Control Tower dashboard with:
  - RAG status cards (Green/Amber/Red counts)
  - Category breakdown chart
  - Overdue compliance table
- Auto-refresh every 5 minutes
- Compliance instances list with filters
- Audit log viewer (role-restricted)

### Technical Implementation Details

**Multi-Tenant Isolation**:
```python
# Every query filters by tenant_id from JWT
query.filter(ComplianceInstance.tenant_id == UUID(tenant_id))

# Entity access also checks tenant_id
accessible_entities = get_user_accessible_entities(
    db, user_id=UUID(current_user["user_id"]), tenant_id=UUID(tenant_id)
)
```

**RBAC Pattern**:
```python
# Check role permission
user_roles = current_user.get("roles", [])
if not check_role_permission(user_roles, ["CFO", "System Admin"]):
    raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Access denied")

# Check entity access
has_access = check_entity_access(
    db, user_id=UUID(current_user["user_id"]),
    entity_id=instance.entity_id, tenant_id=UUID(tenant_id)
)
if not has_access:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Access denied to this entity")
```

**Audit Trail Pattern**:
```python
# Capture old values before update
old_values = {"status": instance.status, "rag_status": instance.rag_status}

# Make changes
instance.status = update_data.status

# Capture new values
new_values = {"status": instance.status, "rag_status": instance.rag_status}

# Commit changes
db.commit()

# Log to audit trail
await log_action(
    db=db, tenant_id=UUID(tenant_id), user_id=UUID(current_user["user_id"]),
    action_type="UPDATE", resource_type="compliance_instance",
    resource_id=instance.id, old_values=old_values, new_values=new_values,
    change_summary=f"Updated compliance instance: {', '.join(changes)}"
)
```

#### ✅ Evidence Service (`app/services/evidence_service.py` - 598 lines)
- **File Validation**: Type and size validation (25 allowed extensions)
- **Hash Generation**: SHA-256 for integrity verification
- **Approval Workflow**: Approve/reject with immutability enforcement
- **Versioning**: Create new versions with parent linking
- **Directory Management**: Organized tenant/entity/instance paths

**Key Functions**:
- `validate_file()` - Validates file type and size
- `generate_file_hash()` - Creates SHA-256 hash
- `get_evidence_directory()` - Constructs storage path
- `approve_evidence()` - Approves and sets immutable
- `reject_evidence()` - Rejects with reason
- `create_evidence_version()` - Creates new version

### Test Implementation

#### Unit Tests (225 tests - 100% passing)

**Compliance Engine Tests** (53 tests):
- Due date calculation for all rule types

- Dependency resolution and blocking logic
- Instance generation logic

**Workflow Engine Tests** (60 tests):
- STANDARD_WORKFLOW constant validation
- Role resolution to user mapping
- Task state transitions (start/complete/reject)
- Sequence enforcement (parent-child dependencies)
- Instance completion checks
- Task queries (overdue, due soon, by user/instance)

**Notification Service Tests** (60 tests):
- NotificationType constants
- CRUD operations with pagination
- Mark read (single and batch)
- Delete operations
- Specific notification helpers (task_assigned, reminders, escalation)
- User isolation verification

**Evidence Service Tests** (52 tests):
- File validation (type, size)
- Hash generation (SHA-256)
- Approval/rejection workflow

#### Integration Tests (27 tests - 100% passing)

**Notifications API Tests** (`tests/integration/api/test_notifications.py`):
- `GET /api/v1/notifications/` - List with pagination and filtering
- `GET /api/v1/notifications/count` - Unread count
- `GET /api/v1/notifications/{id}` - Get single notification
- `PUT /api/v1/notifications/{id}/read` - Mark as read
- `POST /api/v1/notifications/mark-all-read` - Mark all read
- `DELETE /api/v1/notifications/{id}` - Delete notification
- Multi-tenant isolation verification
- User isolation verification
